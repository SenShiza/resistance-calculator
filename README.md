# Resistance Calculator (Java Edition)

## Description

This program will calculate any given resistance in a parallel or series circuit. It uses JOptionPane as GUI.

## Features

- Calculate Parallel Resistances (in kΩ)
- Calculate Series Resistances (in kΩ)

## Future Plans

I would like for this program to not only calculate resistances but also voltage, current, and power in a circuit.
